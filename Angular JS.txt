Angular JS   (https://github.com/MyTraining2018/Angular_FLP)
-------------

Prerequisites:
--------
> HTML 5
> CSS 3
> Java Script_ES6 
> Type Script - superset of JS

> JS doesn't support interfaces etc. So, TS is used to bring many features.
> Open source appn.
> Used for frontend applications
> To develop frontend application, we use angular JS, react HS.
> JSON notaion (JS Object Notation)
> SPA (Single Page Appn.)
> To design SPA, we use Angular JS.
> MVC 
> Event driven
> In Angular JS, we use NPN (Node Package Manager)

> TS has 3 types: string, boolean, number



JS Framework:

NPM ( just like how Maven provides dependencies, NPM manages in JS)
> NPM has package.json file.
> libraries can be found in node-modules folder.

ES5, ES6 - Java Script version/Standard

Transpiler - converts Type script to JS
	- Backward compatibility
	- babel transpiler

Polyfilling: provides backward compatibility to JS.

Testing

Security
> JS is not secure.


Ways of writing A JS:
Internal JS
External JS (preferrable)
Inline JS

> Function level scope
> Block level scope

AJAX: Asynchronous JS and XML

synchronous: immediately needing a response
asynchronous request can be handled by Ajax.


differences:
------------
==  
=== 

eg:
var str="2";
var num=2;

if(str==num)  --> returns true

if (str===num) --> returns false as it is strongly typed [one is str and other is num]



difference between JS and Type script:

why use of type script when JS is being used?
> JS is difficult to understand and is messy.

Java is used rather than Assembly language as it is understandable, high-level.
Similarly, Type JS can be used rather than JS.


v8engine -- engine which executes ur appn in Chrome browser.
chakra -- in IE browser

> Namespaces is a container which stores interfaces, classess and functions.


Visual Studio -- internally has TS supported as it is Microsoft product.

JS -- script can be verified only during runtime.
Type Script -- verified during compile time (TS compiler)
